        "\n",
        "### Visible side\n",

        "Attack Power: She has great destructive power, allowing her to defeat monsters in one go with all her might.\n",
        "Unique Skill: She can reflect an opponent's attack by vibrating her AB sword, the Red Thron. However, it also causes damage to her own body.\n",
